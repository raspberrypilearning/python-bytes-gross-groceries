# Mentor Notes: Gross Groceries

## Project Overview

In this project, learners will use Python to help a strange restaurant owner create a revolting recipe card. They’ll start with simple ingredients and build up to printing full recipe instructions using f-strings. By the end, learners will have used variables, strings, numbers, simple arithmetic, and f-strings across multiple steps.

---

## What Learners Will Practise

- Creating and using variables
- Combining strings and numbers with f-strings
- Performing basic multiplication in code
- Writing multi-line Python programs with clear structure

---

## Teaching Tips

- Encourage learners to come up with their own disgusting ingredients — the sillier, the better!
- Prompt them to read printed output carefully to understand the effect of their changes.
- Reinforce that f-strings are a powerful way to combine text and values without needing multiple `+` symbols.

---

## Extension Ideas

- Let learners use `input()` to ask how many people the recipe should serve
- Encourage them to use `\n` to format multi-line recipe cards
- Add even more ingredients or steps to the recipe
