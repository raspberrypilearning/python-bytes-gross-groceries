# Mentor Notes: Spicy Strings 🌶️🧪

## Project Overview

**Spicy Strings** invites learners to write a Python program that tells a short play in a space café. Zorp (the alien) meets a robot waiter and orders a spicy meal! Along the way, learners use variables, f-strings, string and number multiplication, and spot a mathematical mistake made by the robot.

## What Learners Will Practise

- ✅ Using string and number variables
- ✅ Printing with f-strings and expressions like `{price * quantity}`
- ✅ Using `.upper()` to format text for shouting
- ✅ Repeating emojis using `emoji * level`
- ✅ Debugging an incorrect calculation

---

## Teaching Tips

- Encourage creative values for the variables: names, dishes, emoji, and prices
- Let learners run and modify the starter code to see how it changes the output
- Use the receipt printout to reinforce how variables combine for complex results

---

## Suggested Follow-up

- Continue the "play" format in future lessons with `.replace()` or `input()`
- Introduce user interaction or conditionals for more robot dialogue
