# Mentor Notes: Spicy Strings 🌶️🧪

## Project Overview

**Spicy Strings** is a light-hearted Python project where learners help an alien named Zorp order food in a space café. They will learn to create and format output using **variables**, **f-strings**, and simple **maths** — all wrapped in a fun emoji-filled storyline.

No string methods are used in this lesson — the focus is on formatting, variables, string multiplication, and basic numeric calculations.

---

## What Learners Will Practise

- ✅ Using `f-strings` to format messages with variables
- ✅ Declaring text and number variables
- ✅ Repeating strings with `*`
- ✅ Doing simple maths with variables (e.g. `price * quantity`)

## Key Concepts Introduced

| Concept               | Example                                  |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| f-string formatting    | `f'{name} ordered {item}'`              |
| emoji * number         | `'🌶️' * 5`                              |
| basic calculations     | `price * quantity`                      |
| narrative progression  | Tell a story with data and logic        |

## Teaching Tips

- Let learners play with the emoji and spice levels.
- Encourage them to swap in their own alien names and meals.
- Remind them that f-strings need an `f` in front!
- The robot’s mistake in Step 6 gives learners a chance to "debug".

## Suggested Follow-up

- Introduce `.upper()`, `.lower()` and `.replace()` in the next lesson.
- Invite learners to create a second dish or menu item.
