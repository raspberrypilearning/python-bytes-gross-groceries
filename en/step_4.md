Now it’s time to turn your ingredient list into an actual recipe! 🍲

Your first step will be to describe the number of people being fed and the first ingredient to be added.

### Tip

You can do **maths inside an f-string**!  
This lets you calculate the ingredient amounts and show them inside a sentence without needing extra lines of code.

### Debugging

- Make sure you used `* servings` inside the `{}` for the amount
- Don’t forget the `f` at the start of your string
