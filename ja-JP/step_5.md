<h2 class="c-project-heading--task">Finish your disgusting recipe</h2>

\--- task ---

Use more f-strings to describe how to prepare your ingredients

\--- /task ---

<h2 class="c-project-heading--explainer">Serve it up 🤢</h2>

Let’s finish the recipe by printing the rest of the disgusting instructions.

You’ll describe:

- What to pour in next
- How to garnish it with sprinkles
- How to serve it to your (un)lucky guests!

Add these final lines to your program:

# Print recipe instructions

print()
print(f'Sprinkle with {amount_3 \* servings}g of {ingredient_3} and serve cold 🧊. Yum!')

### Tip

Adding `print()` with nothing in it is a great way to add blank lines in your output.  
You can combine text, variables, and maths all in the same f-string!

### Debugging

- Check that every sentence is inside a `print(f'...')`
- Watch your brackets and punctuation carefully!
